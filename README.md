# Test_Page_For_HTML5_Tutorial_Pls_Ignore

This page is only for my tests with a book I bought, Professional HTML5 Mobile Game Development by Pascal Rettig. Rather than configuring a bunch of stuff with localhost or something, I'm using this random page to follow the tutorial.

So if somehow you found my account, and just happened to click onto this page - well, IDK. It's practically useless unless you want to see a bunch of random experiments with a book I'm reading. xD
